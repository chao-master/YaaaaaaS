            The young colt is crying under a tree, it would seem like no other pony has noticed.
            Next to him is broken flying disk, you go up to him and ask him what is wrong.
            He manages to explin through his sobbing how he borrowed his brother flying disk,
            but then it broke whilst he was playing with it and he dosen't want to upset his brother.
            You figure you could try and help him.
