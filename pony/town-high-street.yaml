        The High street is very busy right now as numerous ponies try to get some lunch from the various stalls that line it.
        After you manage to get into a free spot in the crowd you are able to spot several shops and stalls of potential intrest
        There is a small food stall serving a varity of lovely smelling snacks and sandwhiches
        A sporting stall which seems to be having issues staying well stocked in this weather
        A clothing shop with a varity of dresses in the window display
        And finally the local farmer's apple cart.
        As the crowd moves around you you barely manage to keep track of which way out is.

            The sporting stall seems like the perfect place to replace the young colt's broken flying disk,
            and after much hussling through ponies you are able to talk to the owner.
            Unforntally he informs you he is fresh out of flying disks, like most of his other stock.
            And since his brother is under the weather today he can't leave the stall to restock from his house.

            You fight your way through the crowd but are soon disapointed,
            the sporting stall is pretty much completly out of stock.
