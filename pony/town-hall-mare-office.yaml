        The Mare's office is as bout as well kept as the hallway.
        If it wasn't for the fact the centerpeice was as large as you it could easily still be in here.
        The window is wide open letting in cold air and noise from the green.

            You go upto the window and listen closly and realise you are next to the group of stallions outside.
            Your easedropping reveals they are a no good group of trouble makers and broke into the office a while back,
            taking and hiding the centerpeice as part of a dare.
            You don't manage though to hear where they hid it.
