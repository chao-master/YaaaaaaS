        You find yourself in the busy town center.
        The large water feature in the center catches your attention as does the foals happily playing around it.
        To the north is green where you can hear more ponies enjoying themselves, proably with a picnic around this time.
        Beyond the green you can make out the town hall.
        To the east is the high street where most of the shops and stalls are to be found,
        a delictible coctail of tastes and sounds drift down from there from the various stalls goods and customer bartering.
        To the south is the quickest path out of the town, though it leads to the dark woods,
        normall younger ponies will be found daring each other to stay in as long as possible.
        Finally to the west lays the bulk of the town's houses, the streets rather quiet at this time of day as ponies are out doing other things.
