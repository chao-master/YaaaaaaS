        You come to a small quiet cul-de-sac. There are 6 houses here numbered 3-8 and the route back east.

house 3:
    desc: Whilst it is the first house here it is numbered 3, how strange

house 4:
    desc: A small bunglow, looks like it has a reasonable sized garden out back

house 5:
    desc: A small family house with an extension

            A reasonable sized house, but what grabs your attention is the large number boxes outside that look like
            they contained sporting goods. This looks like it could be there the stall owner and his brother lives.
            As you stand around wondering what to do you spot a rather unwell looking pony slowly grodge his way out towards the mail.
            As he gets near you catch his attention and explain to him how his brother has sold out alread.
            He isn't suprised at all but notes he really can't leave the house, for any extended period of time to resock the stall
            You propose you could try but he shoots down that idea stating he would need some considerable collateral to make sure
            you didn't run off with them. Though after he checks the mail he notes if you *do* find such collateral to come back.

            The sport stall's owner's and his brother house. The aforementioned brother is rather sick right now.
            You decide it's best not to bother him unless you can find the collateral he wants to let you resock the stall.
    '':
        desc: A small house, the garden looks rather unkept and their is quite a bit of carboard that needs collecting.

house 7:
    desc: A rather tall house, it's strange how all the houses here are really diffrent.

house 8:
    desc: It's more of a small manor really...
