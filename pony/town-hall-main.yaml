    desc: >
        The exhibition hall stands just as tall as the lobby, with a slightly raised stage and balcony seats.
        It was designed to hold all of the town residents but that was some decades ago now
        and expecting to keep up with the population growth was a bit extream.
        Right now the decorations are being put up for the summer sun celebration.
        You wonder if you are allowed to be here, but the only other pony seems a little worried about other things.

            You slowly go up to then call out to the mare to see if she is all right, despite clearing not seeming it.
            She manages to explain how the center peice for the celebration tomorrow has dissapeared from her office.
            Since you can't stand to see a pony so distraught like this you offer to help her look, asking first to see her office.
            She gives you a spare key to the offices.

            You reassure the mare you are on the case and she thanks you.
