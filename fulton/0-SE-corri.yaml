        Rain pelts down on the floor to ceiling windows to the south as you move along the wide corridoor.
        A stray table and white board sit ideally, a few spare notes left on from it's last users.
        There is 2 shop fronts on the northen wall here, but one of them is closed.
        Old pictures of house for rent from last year are just visable behind a sign declaring SAS Letting has moved.
        The second shop is advertising numerous travel options and discounts students could get on going places,
        yep thats defintally a travel shop.
        Next to the travel shop at the end of the corridoor are a pair of cash machines,
        though on closer inspection both are out of order.
        To the east is the door to the stair well,
        and tucked to the south of that door is security's.
